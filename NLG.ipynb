            "She is such a dear quiet thing ,' Alice went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , ' and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face -- and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse -- and she ' s such a capital one for catching mice -- oh , I beg your pardon !'\n",
            "cried Alice again , for this time the Mouse was bristling all over , and she felt certain it must be really offended .\n",
